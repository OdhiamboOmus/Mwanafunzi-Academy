3. WHEN a student views the video list THEN the system SHALL display video cards with YouTube thumbnails, titles, duration badges, and subject categorization
4. WHEN a student taps a video card THEN the system SHALL open a modal YouTube player using webview_flutter for lightweight video playback
5. WHEN a student watches a video THEN the system SHALL track viewing progress locally using SharedPreferences for "watched" indicators
6. WHEN the VideoScreen loads THEN all UI elements SHALL animate in using the existing mount animation pattern for consistent user experience

### Requirement 2: Admin Video Management Interface

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to upload and manage YouTube videos through the mobile admin interface using the same grade selector pattern as other admin features, so that I can efficiently organize educational content by grade, subject, and topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses video management THEN the system SHALL display a grade selector dropdown identical to the existing admin quiz management pattern
2. WHEN an admin selects grade and subject THEN the system SHALL show existing videos organized by topic with options to add new videos
3. WHEN an admin adds a new video THEN the system SHALL accept YouTube video URLs and automatically extract video ID, title, and duration metadata
4. WHEN an admin uploads video content THEN the system SHALL validate YouTube URLs and provide real-time preview of video metadata before saving
5. WHEN an admin organizes videos THEN the system SHALL support subject and topic categorization with dropdown selectors matching the existing lesson structure
6. WHEN video changes are saved THEN the system SHALL batch write to Firestore to minimize costs and provide real-time updates to student devices
7. WHEN an admin manages existing videos THEN the system SHALL allow editing video metadata, changing categorization, and removing videos with confirmation dialogs

### Requirement 3: Real-time Video Synchronization

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see newly uploaded videos immediately without restarting the app, so that I always have access to the latest educational content as soon as admin add it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads a new video THEN all student devices SHALL receive real-time updates through Firestore listeners
2. WHEN video content is updated THEN the VideoScreen SHALL refresh the video list automatically without user intervention
3. WHEN network connectivity is available THEN the system SHALL sync video metadata and cache it locally for offline viewing of video lists
4. WHEN students are offline THEN they SHALL be able to view cached video lists but receive appropriate messaging for video playback requiring internet
5. WHEN video synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL use incremental sync to update only changed content for optimal performance
6. WHEN Firestore operations occur THEN the system SHALL implement batch reads and writes to minimize costs and improve performance

### Requirement 4: Grade and Topic Organization

**User Story:** As both admin and student, I want videos organized by grade, subject, and topic in a hierarchical structure, so that content discovery is intuitive and matches the existing lesson organization pattern.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos are stored THEN the system SHALL use Firestore structure `/videos/{grade}/{subject}/{topic}/{videoId}` for consistent organization
2. WHEN students browse videos THEN the system SHALL group videos by subject within their selected grade with clear visual separation
3. WHEN admins manage videos THEN the system SHALL provide subject dropdowns with options: Mathematics, Science, English, Social Studies, and Other
4. WHEN topic organization is implemented THEN admins SHALL be able to create custom topics within subjects for granular content organization
5. WHEN video filtering occurs THEN students SHALL be able to filter by subject within their grade for focused content discovery
6. WHEN video metadata is displayed THEN the system SHALL show grade level, subject, topic, and duration for clear content identification

### Requirement 5: YouTube Integration and Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth YouTube video playback with minimal app size impact, so that the video feature enhances learning without compromising app performance or storage requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YouTube videos are embedded THEN the system SHALL use webview_flutter for lightweight integration without heavy video player dependencies
2. WHEN video thumbnails are displayed THEN the system SHALL use YouTube's CDN thumbnail URLs to avoid local storage and reduce app size
3. WHEN video metadata is extracted THEN the system SHALL use YouTube's oEmbed API or URL parsing to get title, duration, and thumbnail information
4. WHEN video playback occurs THEN the system SHALL handle loading states, error fallbacks, and fullscreen toggle options within the modal player
5. WHEN video URLs are validated THEN the system SHALL accept various YouTube URL formats (youtube.com, youtu.be, mobile links) and normalize them to video IDs
6. WHEN app size is measured THEN the video feature addition SHALL not exceed 200KB total size impact following Flutter Lite rules

### Requirement 6: Offline Capability and Caching

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see available videos even when offline, so that I can plan my learning activities and access content when internet connectivity is restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video metadata is loaded THEN the system SHALL cache video lists, titles, and metadata locally using SharedPreferences
2. WHEN students are offline THEN they SHALL see cached video lists with clear indicators that internet is required for playback
3. WHEN video viewing history is tracked THEN the system SHALL store "watched" status locally and sync with Firestore when online
4. WHEN cache management occurs THEN the system SHALL implement LRU cache eviction to prevent excessive local storage usage
5. WHEN network connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync local changes with Firestore in the background
6. WHEN offline indicators are shown THEN students SHALL receive clear messaging about internet requirements for video playback

### Requirement 7: Performance and Size Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the video feature to maintain app performance and follow Flutter Lite principles, so that the app remains fast and lightweight on all devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video features are added THEN the total app size increase SHALL not exceed 200KB following Flutter Lite rules
2. WHEN video screens are loaded THEN all files SHALL remain under 150 lines of code for optimal tree-shaking and maintainability
3. WHEN video lists are displayed THEN the system SHALL use ListView.builder for efficient rendering of large video collections
4. WHEN video thumbnails load THEN the system SHALL implement loading skeletons and lazy loading for smooth user experience
5. WHEN video operations occur THEN the system SHALL dispose of webview controllers properly to prevent memory leaks
6. WHEN Firebase operations execute THEN the system SHALL batch reads and writes to minimize Firestore costs and improve performance
7. WHEN app performance is measured THEN video loading and admin operations SHALL complete within 2 seconds on mid-range devices

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Systems
